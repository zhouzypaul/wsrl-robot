    Tracks the mean of the most recent N episodes for return, length, and time.

    This wrapper works in conjunction with RecordEpisodeStatistics. It assumes
    that RecordEpisodeStatistics wraps the environment *before* this wrapper.
    It reads the 'episode' dictionary from the info returned by the final step
    of an episode and calculates the moving average of 'r', 'l', and 't'
    over the last `n` episodes.

        env (gym.Env): The environment to wrap.
        n (int): The number of past episodes to calculate the average over.
        stats_prefix (str): The prefix to use for the logged average statistics.
